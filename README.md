'Subreddit' should be changed to your subreddit name.

  1. Go to /r/subreddit/about/stylesheet
  2. Paste the CSS from the 'Naut 4 - Main CSS File.css' file into the CSS textarea.
  3. Upload the images from the /images/ folder. (Don't rename them!)
  4. Hit save!

Now you can customize it by either adding customization lines yourself, or by visiting the [/r/Naut wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/naut/wiki/index) and customizing it yourself!

If you have any questions on how to customize, [/r/CSSHelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp) might be better suited than [/r/Naut](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naut)!
